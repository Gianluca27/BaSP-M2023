# Radium Rocket: Become a Software Professional

## Week-01
First week of the bootcamp, here we learned about agile methodologies such as scrum. 
We also learned how to use Figma to create a screenflow for a webpage, in this case 
we had to desing the screens for a gym's webpage. Students were assigned in different
groups to divide

## Week-02
In this week we used HTML language for the first time as well as git. We learned how
to create a local repository and how to push it to a remote one via commands. The 
assingment this week was to create the HTML version of the landing page desinged last
week on Figma. Each student had to make their own version of it.

## Week-03
In Week-03 we learned CSS and we are using it to give style to the landing page. 
The idea was to make the webpage look exactly like our Figma desing (ref. Week-02)
I think most students struggled a bit throughout this week, incluiding me. But
we are making progress :).

## Week-04
This week we implemented flexbox to our previous CSS code, this way our webpage is
now responsive, wich means that items grow or shrink depending on the current 
resolution of the device that is opening the page. Things were a bit easier than last 
week but it was still very challenging and interesting to learn a new way of giving
style to a webpage.

## Week-05
In this week we learned how to use JavaScript and we had to complete different
excercises to fully understand all the fundamentals of this new language. Personally
I had learned C language before and its vere similar to JS so it was good to review
some of the stuff I had already learned.
