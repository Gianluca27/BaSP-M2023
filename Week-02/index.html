                <h2>About us</h2>
                    <p>Megarocket SA gym was founded in 1995 by a former Olympic athlete named Max Strong.
                       Max had always been passionate about fitness and wanted to create a gym that would
                       provide people with a welcoming and inclusive environment to pursue their fitness goals.
                       Over the years, Megarocket SA grew into one of the most popular gyms in the city, with
                       a thriving community of members who were passionate about fitness. Max continued to run
                       the gym until he retired in 2020.</p>
